In this Case Study, I will assume the position of a Junior Data Analyst at a bike-share company in Chicago. The company renders its services to two types of customers:

* Casual Members - Customers who avail single single-ride or full-day passes
* Annual Members - Customers who purchased an annual membership
  
The stakeholders of this company believe that maximizing the number of annual members would define the company's future success. The company would like to gather insights on how annual and casual members use Cyclistic differently to craft a data-driven plan to convert casual riders to annual members which would be my task as a part of their analytics team.

## Ask
The business problem we're trying to solve here is how to convince casual members into annual members. Finding the difference between a casual to an annual member can possibly shed light on factors why they chose a specific type of membership. Considering these statements, the following business task is formulated:

"Through analyzing the difference between casual and annual members, the factors affecting their decision to commit to a certain type of membership would be identified and which would help in crafting a data-driven plan to convert more customers to avail the desired annual membership"

## Prepare

The data used in this case study were stored in an Amazon AWS cloud database, made available by Motivate International Inc. The datasets were compressed into zip files, each file sorted in two ways, either per month or per quarter. The zip files organized per month have their file name consisting of the year and the month of each dataset followed by -divvy-tripdata. This will be the dataset chosen for analysis and the latest data which is from March 2022 to March 2023 will be used. 

#### Assessing the credibility of the data
To assess the credibility of the chosen data, we'll examine it closely using the "ROCCC" framework, as follows:
* ***Reliable*** - The chosen data is publicly available and has a data license agreement. It is a suggested dataset by the Google Data Analytics course proving its fit for use. (from good source)
* ***Original*** - The dataset was from a third-party source and upon looking at the source, its originality is verified as it is owned by the city of Chicago and made available to the public.
* ***Comprehensive*** - Our problem at hand aims to find the difference between each type of user in the bike-sharing company. The dataset provides comprehensive information about the users of a bike-sharing company along with the type of membership of each user/
* ***Current*** - The most recent dataset chosen includes this year's and last year's data which shows its relevance and up-to-date.  
* ***Cited*** - Examining the data license agreement, the data used is well-cited.

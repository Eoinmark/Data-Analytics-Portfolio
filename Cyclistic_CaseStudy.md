In this Case Study, I will assume the position of a Junior Data Analyst at a bike-share company in Chicago. The company renders its services to two types of customers:

* Casual Members - Customers who avail single single-ride or full-day passes
* Annual Members - Customers who purchased an annual membership
  
The stakeholders of this company believe that maximizing the number of annual members would define the company's future success. The company would like to gather insights on how annual and casual members use Cyclistic differently to craft a data-driven plan to convert casual riders to annual members which would be my task as a part of their analytics team.

## Ask
The business problem we're trying to solve here is how to convince casual members into annual members. Finding the difference between a casual to an annual member can possibly shed light on factors why they chose a certain type of membership. Considering these statements, the following business task is formulated:

"Through analyzing the difference between casual and annual members, the factors affecting their decision to commit to a certain type of membership would be identified and which would help in crafting a data-driven plan to convert more customers to avail the desired annual membership"

## Prepare

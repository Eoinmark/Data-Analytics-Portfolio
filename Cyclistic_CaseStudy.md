# About this case study
In this Case Study, I will assume the position of a Junior Data Analyst at a bike-share company in Chicago. The company renders its services to two types of customers:

* Casual Members - Customers who avail single single-ride or full-day passes
* Annual Members - Customers who purchased an annual membership
  
The stakeholders of this company believe that maximizing the number of annual members would define the company's future success. The company would like to gather insights on how annual and casual members use Cyclistic differently to craft a data-driven plan to convert casual riders to annual members which would be my task as a part of their analytics team.

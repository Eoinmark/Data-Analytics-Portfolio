In this case study, I used Python's Pandas library to perform data cleaning, wrangling, preprocessing, and analysis from a bike-sharing company's customer database to generate data-driven insights. Also, I used SQL queries using MySQL to perform further analysis of the data and Tableau for data visualization and presented my suggestions based on the key findings of my analysis.

How patterns form in nature such as the pattern found in Jaguar's fur has long been a subject of interest to experts. The reaction-diffusion equation developed by Alan Turing models mechanism. In this notebook, I simulated pattern formation through this model and explored this equation using Python. Python's Numpy library and Scipy library were used to solve this equation and Matplotlib was used for visualization.

The popular idea of the butterfly effect has its roots in the real-life implication of the Lorenz Attractor. This notebook explored this strange attractor and simulated this model defined by the Lorenz equation which is a system of ordinary differential equations. I used Python's Numpy library and Scipy library to solve these differential equations and Matplotlib for visualization.

The dynamics of the population of predator and prey is an interest of study in ecology. I explored and simulated in this notebook their population dynamics using the Lottka-Volterra Model, a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations that represent how the predator-prey population interacts. I used Python's Numpy library and Scipy library to solve these differential equations and Matplotlib for visualization.

In this notebook, I explored the behavior of a logistic map, which is a mathematical function used in modeling population growth, and its sensitive dependence on its parameters. For this, I used Python's NumPy library to evaluate its recurring equation and Matplotlib library for visualization.

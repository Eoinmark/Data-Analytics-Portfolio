In this project, I used Python's Pandas library to perform data cleaning, wrangling, preprocessing, and analysis from a bike-sharing company's customer database to generate data-driven insights. Also, I used SQL queries using MySQL to perform further analysis of the data and Tableau for data visualization and presented my suggestions based on the key findings of my analysis.

This is a case study I accomplished as a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics course. I assumed the position of a junior data analyst for a bike-share company called Cyclistics. For this role, I used Python's Pandas library to perform data cleaning, data wrangling, data preprocessing and data analysis from the company's customer database to generate data-driven insights. Also, I used SQL queries using MySQL to perform further analysis on the data and Tableu for data visualization and presenting my suggestions based on the key finding of my analysis.
